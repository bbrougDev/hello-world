# hello-world
This is my very first Github repository
My name is Bradley. I am currently learning to use Github whilst also learning to use JavaScript for different frameworks. My next step, after learning JavaScript, is to learn Angular.
I have completed my HND in Computer Science and am now taking a yevar off to work. During this year I will be researching and learning different programming languages and frameworks for front-end development.
